        "Data Cleaning: The initial step to take with problem 3 is Data Cleaning, First thing is to load the excel sheet into the data frame, afterwards you will take the values created and IN PLACE (this is important to save data when doing operations on large datasets) remove all empty string/null values from the dataset. This is done to handle missing values. To do this we find all nulls in the dataframe, next we replace all nulls with the mean. This statsitically doesnt change much as we are using the average of the column (if theyre numeric). Afterwards we check to see if there are no missing values left in the data frame.\n",
